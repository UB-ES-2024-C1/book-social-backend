    "title": "Love's Oneing",
    "author_name": "Kerrie Hide",
    "synopsis": "Grounded in Christian love mysticism, Love’s Oneing gives voice to the luminous consciousness that awakens from within our oneness in God in contemplation. With great sensitivity, the book offers nuanced insight into the marriage of kenosis and desire in contemplation, through the rich tapestry of writings from nine mystics: Julian of Norwich, the Cloud of Unknowing author, Meister Eckhart, Mechthild of Magdeburg, Clare of Assisi, John of the Cross, Teilhard de Chardin, Beatrice Bruteau and Ilia Delio. With the delicate eye of a spiritual director immersed in mystical literature, Kerrie Hide situates these mystical teachings within contemplative prayer, whilst offering a scholarly exploration of contemplative practice to embody the insights. Deeply grounded in traditional and contemporary mystical classics, Hide celebrates how the Christian mystical tradition lays a foundation for the evolutionary growth of communion consciousness and the insights of quantum science, highlighting key moments in contemplation that when surrendered into, open into divine love. Born of intellectual reflection, lived experience and contemplative wisdom, Love’s Oneing makes a unique contribution to the existing literature on contemplation at a time when the recovery of the mystical dimension of life is crucial for the future of our planet in this climate crisis moment.",

These three women are the voices of the Wolf clan, their complex relationships exquisitely intertwined. The pre-war years reveal an America seemingly uninterested in what is happening during Hitler's rise to power-yet there are exceptions, with the three women working against the dark regime. What are their secrets?",
